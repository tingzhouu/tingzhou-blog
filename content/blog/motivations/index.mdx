### Why I'm Here

I started off learning [React Native](https://www.reactnative.dev), which is a little
unconventional as most people start off with React before moving to React Native. While
this might sound crazy, I get quite fascinated over websites. It's probably because simply because
I don't know how to build one, especially the styling aspect.

After working on a phone screen for so long, thinking about large laptop-sized screens daunts me.
I've tried out online courses to learn HTML and CSS but the information never seems to go into my head.
So, what better way to learn than make my own?

Another reason for starting this blog is knowledge sharing.
Doesn't everyone have this thought after having spent a very long time finding out how to do something?

### Why Gatsby?

I was so amazed when I discovered that [Kent C Dodd's blog posts](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/automation) were written in markdown.
I also found [this](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/goodbye-medium) to be a good reason not to use online
publishing platforms. I'm glad that the blogs of [Kent C Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com) and
[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) were open-sourced, which made it easier for me to know what was
happening and how it was done. When I realised they were using Gatsby, I decided to try it out for myself too.
Credits to them!

  )
}

export default Hello;
