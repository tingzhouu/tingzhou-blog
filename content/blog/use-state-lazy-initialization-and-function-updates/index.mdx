_When to pass a function to useState and setState_

If you've been working with React for a while, you've probably used `useState`.
Here's a quick example of the API:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

So, you call `useState` with the initial state value, and it returns an array
with the value of that state and a mechanism for updating it (which is called
the "state `dispatch` function"). When you call the state dispatch function, you
pass the new value for the state and that triggers a re-render of the component
which leads to useState getting called again to retrieve the new state value and
the dispatch function again.

This is one of the first things you learn about state when you're getting into
React (at least, it is if you
[learn from my free course](https://kcd.im/beginner-react)). But there's a
lesser known feature of both the `useState` call and the `dispatch` function
that can be useful at times:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(() => 0)
  const increment = () => setCount(previousCount => previousCount + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

The difference is that `useState` in this example is called with a _function
that returns_ the initial state (rather than simply passing the initial state)
and `setCount` (dispatch) is called with a function that accepts the previous
state value and returns the new one. This functions exactly the same as the
previous example, but there are subtle differences that we'll get into in this
post. I teach about this in
[my free React course](https://kcd.im/beginner-react) as well, but I get asked
about it enough that I thought I'd write about it as well.

## useState Lazy initialization

If you were to add a `console.log` to the function body of the Counter function,
you would find that the function is run every time you click the button. This
makes sense because your Counter function is run during every render phase and
clicking the button triggers the state update which triggers the re-render. One
thing you need to keep in mind is that if the function body runs, that means all
the code inside it runs as well. Which means any variables you create or
arguments you pass are created and evaluated every render. This is normally not
a big deal because JavaScript engines are very fast and can optimize for this
kind of thing. So something like this would be no problem:

```javascript
const initialState = 0
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialState)
```


However, what if the initial value for your state is computationally expensive?

```javascript
const initialState = calculateSomethingExpensive(props)
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialState)
```

Or, more practically, what if you need to read into `localStorage` which is an
IO operation?

```javascript
const initialState = Number(window.localStorage.getItem('count'))
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialState)
```

Remember that the only time React needs the _initial_ state is _initially_ ðŸ˜‰
Meaning, it only really needs the initial state on the first render. But because
our function body runs every time there's a re-render of our component, we end
up running that code on every render, even if its value is not used or needed.

This is what the lazy initialization is all about. It allows you to put that
code in a function:

```javascript
const getInitialState = () => Number(window.localStorage.getItem('count'))
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(getInitialState)
```

Creating a function is fast. Even if what the function does is computationally
expensive. So you only pay the performance penalty when you _call_ the function.
So if you pass a function to `useState`, React will only call the function when
it needs the initial value (which is when the component is initially rendered).

This is called "lazy initialization." It's a performance optimization. You
shouldn't have to use it a whole lot, but it can be useful in some situations,
so it's good to know that it's a feature that exists and you can use it when
needed. I would say I use this only 2% of the time. It's not really a feature I
use often.

## `dispatch` function updates

This one's a little bit more complicated. The easiest way to explain what it's
for is by showing an example. Let's say that before we can update our count
state, we need to do something async:

```jsx
function DelayedCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = async () => {
    await doSomethingAsync()
    setCount(count + 1)
  }
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

Let's say that async thing takes 500ms. That's rendered here, click this button
three times really fast:

<Rendered>
  <DelayedCounterBug />
</Rendered>

If you clicked it fast enough, you'll notice that the count was only incremented
to 1. But that's weird, because if you added a `console.log` to the `increment`
function, you'll find that it's called three times (once for every click), so
why is the count state not updated three times?

Well, this is where things get tricky. The fact is that the state _is_ updated
three times (once for every click), but if you added a `console.log(count)`
right above the `setCount` call, you'd notice that `count` is `0` every time! So
we're calling `setCount(0 + 1)` for every click, even though we actually want to
increment the count.

So why is the count `0` every time? It's because the `increment` function that
we've given to React through the `onClick` prop on that `button` "closes over"
the value of `count` at the time it's created. You can
[learn more about closures from whatthefork.is/closure](https://whatthefork.is/closure),
but in short, when a function is created, it has access to the variables defined
outside of it and even if what those variables are assigned to changes.

The problem is that we're actually calling the exact same `increment` function
which has closed over the value of `0` for the `count` before it has a chance to
update based on the previous click and it stays that way until React re-renders.
