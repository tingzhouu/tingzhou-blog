# Ting Zhou's Blog

I started this blog for 2 reasons:

1. To write and share about my learnings.
2. Get some experience on web development.

This was created using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Credits to [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) and [Kent C Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com) where I referenced their blogs on how to implement certain features.
